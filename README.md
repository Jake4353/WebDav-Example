# WebDav-Example

you will need to make a folder called "new" in the directory

This is just a simple example of what webdav can do. this was only made for fun and to build up to a bigger and better project.

i know its not good or practical but it was just for fun, if you need any info, add Cowski#1234 on discord, im pretty active 


Only 1 package is need for this:
    pip install webdavclient3
